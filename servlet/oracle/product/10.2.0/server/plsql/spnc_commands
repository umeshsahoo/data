# This file contains commands to generate a shared object or DLL
# for a natively compiled PL/SQL unit. 
# This file can have multiple commands. 
# Each command should be specified in a single line by itself terminated by
# a newline.
# Lines starting with a # character are comments which are ignored.
# Each command is executed by creating (forking) a process and
# giving the command to the process to be executed directly.
# That means no other program (such as a shell or make) is used
# to interpret these commands.
# The command(s) use the following symbolic names as placeholders
# which will be replaced by actual names before executing the command(s).
#
# 	%(src) -  refers to the name of the generated C source file.
# 	%(obj) -  refers to the name of the generated object file.
# 	%(dll)  -  refers to the name of the generated dll file.

# The variable $(ORACLE_HOME) will be replaced by its actual value
# before executing the command(s).

# The /Zm option is needed only when compiling a large plsql procedure.

cl.exe %(src) /nologo /Zm200 /Og /Oy /MD /Fo%(obj) /I$(ORACLE_HOME)/rdbms/public /I$(ORACLE_HOME)/plsql/include /link /nologo /dll $(ORACLE_HOME)/lib/orapls10.lib /out:%(dll)

#GCC (MINGW) is now supported for plsql native comp on windows.
#Download MinGW-3.1.0-1.exe from http://www.mingw.org.
#The following two commands assume that GCC is installed at the default
#location which is c:/MinGW. Change the paths to gcc and ld appropriately
#if the installation is done in a different directory.
#Finally, to use GCC for native comp, comment the above command line for cl.exe
#and uncomment the following two comand lines.
#c:/MinGW/bin/gcc -c %(src) -O1 -I$(ORACLE_HOME)/rdbms/public -I$(ORACLE_HOME)/plsql/include -o %(obj)
#c:/MinGW/bin/ld -shared -e 0x0 %(obj) $(ORACLE_HOME)/plsql/lib/libpncrt.a $(ORACLE_HOME)/lib/orapls10.lib -o %(dll)
